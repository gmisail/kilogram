TODO:

# Short Term

- Figure out how to add nested function pointers, i.e. a function pointer is 
an argument to a function that returns a function pointer (write tests for this maybe?)

- Add 'rec' keyword for recursive functions; introduces a pointer of itself to the expression.
	- While typechecking, make sure that 'rec' is only used with functions. So:

	Good
	```
	let rec fibonacci ...
	```

	Bad
	```
	let rec pi: float = pi + 1 <-- what does this even mean
	```

# Long Term

- Add external function definitions
- Write a string library
- Get a trivial program compiling
